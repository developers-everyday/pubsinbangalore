🍻 PUBS DIRECTORY — DATA ENRICHMENT FRAMEWORK


🧩 1. Understand the Goal

The scraped data (from Google Maps or similar) contains the basic facts —

name, address, rating, phone, website, working hours, Google Maps link.

But to make The site truly useful and SEO-rich, we’ll enrich this with experience-based and emotional data:

“What people want to know before visiting a pub.”

🔍 2. Finding Enrichment Attributes for Pubs

Like Frey used Reddit + Google + Ahrefs to find dog park attributes,
we’ll do the same for pubs.

Step A: Use Google Maps Reviews

Search “pubs in Bangalore” → open top pubs → look for repeated review “tags” or words:

“great music”, “crowded”, “rooftop”, “dance floor”, “cocktails”, “pet friendly”, etc.

Step B: Check Reddit & Quora 

Search:

“Best pubs in Bangalore Reddit”

“Safe pubs for women in Bangalore”

“Pub with live music Bangalore”

Collect common themes from comments — people often mention things like:

“Good crowd”

“Affordable drinks”

“Good DJ”

“Couples entry”

“Open till late”

Step C: Use Ahrefs or Keyword Tool

Search modifiers around “pubs near me”:

rooftop pubs

pubs with dance floor

live music pubs

ladies night pubs

pet-friendly pubs

budget pubs

romantic pubs

💡 3. Finalize The Enrichment Attribute List

Here’s a starting list of 15-20 enrichment columns we can track per pub 👇

Attribute	Type	Example Values
Rooftop	Boolean	TRUE/FALSE
Live Music	Boolean	TRUE/FALSE
Dance Floor	Boolean	TRUE/FALSE
DJ Nights	Boolean	TRUE/FALSE
Pet Friendly	Boolean	TRUE/FALSE
Ladies Night	Boolean	TRUE/FALSE
Couple Entry Allowed	Boolean	TRUE/FALSE
Family Friendly	Boolean	TRUE/FALSE
Serves Food	Boolean	TRUE/FALSE
Parking Available	Boolean	TRUE/FALSE
Smoking Area	Boolean	TRUE/FALSE
Outdoor Seating	Boolean	TRUE/FALSE
Sports Screening	Boolean	TRUE/FALSE
Happy Hours	Boolean	TRUE/FALSE
Craft Beer	Boolean	TRUE/FALSE
Cocktail Bar	Boolean	TRUE/FALSE
Price Range	Text	“₹₹₹”
Ambience Type	Text	“Casual / Romantic / Loud / Lounge”
Rating Count	Numeric	“4.3 (2,000+ reviews)”

⚙️ 4. Preparing The Base Dataset

From The Google Maps scraper (e.g., OutScraper), make sure we include:

Name

Full Address

City

State

Google Maps URL

Working Hours

Website

Phone

Rating

Review Count

Business Status

✅ Enable the “location_link” column — this is key for automated enrichment later.

🤖 5. Automate Attribute Enrichment
Option A — Scripted or API-based

Create a small script (Python or GPT-powered workflow) that:

Visits each pub’s Google Maps link.

Scrapes or fetches its reviews.

Checks for The keywords (“rooftop”, “DJ”, “live music” etc.).

Returns TRUE / FALSE / Not Found.

Option B — AI Review Analyzer (simpler)

Use GPT (with Sheets or API) to process each review text column.

Prompt example for automation:

“Based on the following reviews, tell me whether this pub has live music, a rooftop area, and a dance floor. Return TRUE/FALSE for each.”

Then structure it into columns:

Pub Name	Live Music	Rooftop	Dance Floor	Parking	Pet Friendly
✍️ 6. Generate AI Descriptions for Each Pub

Use GPT for Sheets or Claude for Sheets like Frey did.

Example prompt (adapted for The case):

“Write a 3-sentence description of {{Pub Name}} in {{Area, City}}.
Mention if it offers {{Live Music, Rooftop, Outdoor Seating, Pet Friendly, etc.}}.
Keep it friendly, easy to read, and naturally include the keyword ‘pub in {{City}}’. Limit to 60 words.”

Example Output:

“Gilly’s Restobar is a lively rooftop pub in Koramangala, Bangalore. Known for its live music nights, craft beer, and upbeat vibe, it’s perfect for weekend parties. Guests love its friendly staff and outdoor seating that overlooks the city lights.”

🧹 7. Merge and Clean the Final CSV

The final Enriched Pub Dataset should include:
| Pub Name | City | Area | Rating | Rooftop | Live Music | Pet Friendly | Price Range | Ambience | Description | Google Maps Link |

Clean duplicates, normalize case, and ensure TRUE/FALSE consistency.

🌐 8. Enrich URLs or Listings for SEO

Add formulaic SEO enhancements:

Title: =CONCATENATE(A2," - ",C2," Pub in Bangalore")

Slug: LOWER(SUBSTITUTE(A2," ","-"))

Meta Description: Auto-generate using attributes.

🧾 9. Import to WordPress (Later Phase)

Once enriched, import into WordPress (via WP All Import + JetEngine), mapping:

Custom Fields = The enrichment attributes

Taxonomies = City, Area

Dynamic template = listing layout per city

🚀 10. (Optional) Add AI “Insight” Enrichment

For each listing, you can generate one unique insight:

“What makes this pub stand out compared to others nearby?”

Prompt:

“Based on these attributes, write one short unique insight about why someone should visit {{Pub Name}} in {{Area}}.”

Output:

“Ideal for live-music lovers who enjoy open-air vibes and late-night crowd energy.”
